/**
 * portal-cutover-guard.ts — skip the historical→realtime cutover refetch for fully-bounded chains.
 *
 * After ponder's historical backfill drains, its cutover loop live-probes EVERY chain's head
 * (`eth_getBlockByNumber("latest")` → a finalized-target fetch, under
 * `logger.child({ action: "refetch_finalized_block" })`) inside a `Promise.all` across all chains,
 * and this probe sits ON THE READINESS CRITICAL PATH — `/ready` only flips 200 once the generator
 * returns. For a chain with a configured historical end block that is already at or below the current
 * finalized block, that probe is provably RANGE-NEUTRAL: the backfill's upper bound is
 * `to = min(finalized, end)`, a refetch can only RAISE `finalized`, and `min(higher, end) = end` is
 * unchanged — no interval is added or removed. Realtime is skipped anyway for such a chain
 * (`syncProgress.isEnd()` is true, so `getRealtimeEventGenerator` returns early). Yet a flaky RPC that
 * makes the probe reject (e.g. JSON-RPC "Missing or invalid parameters" / -32602, which
 * `rpc/index.ts` `shouldRetry` treats as retryable → 10 attempts with backoff) delays readiness for
 * minutes and, on retry exhaustion, escapes the fire-and-forget runner as an unhandledRejection that
 * kills a FULLY-INDEXED app with exit code 75 before `/ready` ever serves 200. With omnichain ordering
 * the probe is UNCONDITIONAL (no 30s freshness gate), so a permanently-failing RPC blocks completion
 * across restarts.
 *
 * The guard (INV-18): compute `isEndCapped := end !== undefined && end.number <= finalized.number`
 * per chain, EXCLUDE end-capped chains from the cutover probe set, and skip the round entirely when
 * ALL chains are end-capped (a fully-bounded app performs ZERO cutover refetches). Unbounded and
 * finality-capped chains (`end === undefined`, or `end` still ABOVE finalized) keep today's behavior
 * EXACTLY — including the fork's stream-mode clamp that the wiring patch applies right after the probe.
 *
 * The predicate is monotone: `end <= finalized` holds at start and `finalized` only ever rises across
 * cutover iterations, so an end-capped chain stays end-capped — the guard never flips a chain back into
 * the probe set mid-loop.
 *
 * Pure w.r.t. I/O and env: it reads only block numbers, so it is unit-testable without any RPC/network.
